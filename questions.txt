Memoization:
 * supports nesting templates using an internal template mechanism (see templatingBehaviors.js for an example)
 * default behavior is to re-write data-bind attributes in a text-based template so that the binding objects are evaluated in the context of the internal template rendering function

Questions: How important are these features? Would people miss them if they were gone? Is there another way to accomplish them?


View model that's an observable:
 * applyBindings accepts an observable view model (see applyBindingsToNodeInternal for evidence).
 * Since the view model is unwrapped for each element, writing to the observable (or calling notify..) will refresh all the bindings.

Questions: Does anyone use this? Maybe there's another way to accomplish refreshing all the bindings.


Possible way to divide changes for independent bindings:

1. multi-node disposal for computed observables
2. single bindingContext (handle observable view model)
3. new syntax for two-level bindings (either using binding flags or "preprocess")
4. options for apply bindings
5. independent bindings (wrap values in preprocess, unwrap in applybindings, separate computed for each binding)
